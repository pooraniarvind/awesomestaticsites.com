<p> <b>“I am convinced that He (God) does not play dice." - Einstein </b> </p>

Was Einstein right? The theory of chaos rekindles our thinking and raises skepticism on basic assumptions made by great scientists and thinkers on the way the universe behaves.

The deterministic view says the state of universe at one time decides the state at all other times. But determinism is impossible in microphysical or lower levels. Einstein himself agrees that we cannot make precise predictions of what is going to happen at a micro-physical level. The above deterministic statement is a theory, but in practice does Universe behave according to these notions. Doesn’t Universe keep surprising us? What is limiting us from predicting our future? The answer may lie in the chaos theory.

The word “chaos” means a state of confusion or lack of any order but in scientiﬁc context, the chaos theory is a noticeable lack of order in a system that nonetheless follows laws/rules. The chaos theory is based on the assumption that no matter how complex the system is, it relies on an underlying order and very simple and small variation can cause complex behaviors or events. With the above assumption, the chaos theory states that the slightest diferences in the measurement which are beyond human ability to measure can make prediction of past or future impossible.

Does really the fourth, ﬁfth, sixth decimal places which are difficult to measure using reasonable methods have such huge effect or small variations in a system can produce profound changes in that system. Does ﬂapping of a single butterﬂy's wing in Brazil set of a tornado in Texas? The ﬂapping of wing represents a small change in the system, which leads to chain of events resulting in large-scale phenomena. Scientists call this the butterﬂy effect. Butterﬂy effect inﬂuences weather patterns to ﬂuctua-tions in stock market.

Prof. Stephen Hawking in one of his public speeches says the universe does not behave according to our pre-conceived ideas. It continues to surprise us. He goes on to say Einstein was doubly wrong when he said, God does not play dice. Not only does God deﬁnitely play dice, but He sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can't be seen.

Butterfly effect is depicted in many sci-fi movies such as Jurassic Park, Pi, It’s a Wonderful Life, Chaos Theory, etc. The Tamil movie Dasavatharam is based on butterfly effect wherein a small event that happens in the 12th century results in a series of events later. The best examples are the movies Pi and It’s a Wonderful Life. Pi is a film about a mathematical genius who theorizes the mysterious 216-digit number and this number pattern helps him to make accurate picks in the stock market. It’s A Wonderful Life offers a very different message that how one man’s life can make a huge difference in the world. It is the story of a man who is so very dejected about his life and he after getting a wish granted by an angel realizes how even an small and insignificant individual like him could have great effect on the world around him.
