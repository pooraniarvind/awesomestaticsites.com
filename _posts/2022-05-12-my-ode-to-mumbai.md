Though born in South India I spent most of my growing years in Northern part of India. In 1977, my family moved from Calcutta to Mumbai (it still is Bombay to me), and in this city, I spent most of my growing/schooling years.

A lot of my personality was shaped while growing up here. This city allowed me to be myself. In Mumbai, nobody will ever ask you who or what your parents are nor will they judge you by your origin orfinancial status of your parents.

The best thing about this city is its people, their warmth, care, culture,comradeship and all this bundled together. A city so lively, so full of life and a city that never sleeps. A resident of Mumbai is a person who smiles in spite of all the rush and hurry; he/she seldom refuses to help a fellow passenger/neighbor/colleague, and he is always around to help without questioning
about ones roots.

Personally, I have learnt a lot from this city, it has taught me to be always on my toes, value hard earned money, give great significance or importance to the minute hand in my watch, follow stock market quote as passionately as cricket score, etc.

These verses from a famous song in Gurudutt’s movie CID depict a soulless Mumbai,
"Kahin building, Kahin tramein, Kahin Motor, Kahin Mill,
Milta hai yehan sab kucch, par milta nahin dil."

But I would rather say the verses that actually depict real Mumbai are these:
“Jo hai karta woh hai bharta hai yahan ka yeh chalan
Tadbeer nahin chalne ki yahan
Yeh hai Bombay, yeh hai Bombay, yeh hai Bombay meri jaan .”

As I end penning these lines, my thoughts drift back to awesome force of the Mumbai monsoon that blows ones umbrella inside out, the rhythm of the fast trains, the bindaas attitude of Mumbaikars, the cutting chai and vada pav.
