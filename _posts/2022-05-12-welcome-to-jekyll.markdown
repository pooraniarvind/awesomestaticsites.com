<p>I am still in the process of moving my WordPress blog content to the site. I am also planning to build a portfoliio of the my documentation projects in this site.</p>

<p>This blog is built with Jekyll, Git and GitHub. For continuous content publishing, I created a CI pipeline in TravisCI to automate the site build and publishing. So each time I push content to my GitHub repository, the CI publishing pipeline deploys the updates to my website.</P>  

<p>The website is with HTTPS on AWS, using S3 and CloudFront.</p>
