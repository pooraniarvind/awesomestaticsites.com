<p><b>An article based on a special interest group discussion on "Beyond usability:
taking social, situational, cultural, and other contextual factors into account." </b></p>

Usability is about supporting ease of use. However, usability is only part of design and is not the fundamental basis for every design. How about going to the next level from just ease of use and think about what is better to use, new to use, or what gives a new role to the users as a design.

For design and evaluation in human–computer interaction (HCI), we have often relied on scientific measurements of efficiency and error. The projective measurements, emotional impact, or qualitative measurements may be hard to achieve through testing. Testing cannot predict everything; it may allow you to design for specific instances. In general, design in industry is unproven and this will make us skeptical about how we can rise to the level where we can identify our users’ requirements.

How are we going to impact various levels of the users’ lives such as emotion, security, accomplishment, progress, social context, enjoyment, engagement, and tasks? Interpreting highly contextual factors such as gender and culture is difficult and it depends on who you are, it may alter how you see and translate these things.

Although usability and usefulness are still primary concerns, designers in the field are moving beyond and are investigating a variety of approaches such as user experience, aesthetic
interaction, ambiguity, slow technology, and various ways to understand the social, cultural, and other contextual aspects of our world.

Theories such as cognitive science, cultural theory, learning theory, critical theory can help us in understanding the context and relationship. But how can we leverage this to give people a better experience to help select and synthesize rather than evaluate.

There are many areas that we can bring in theoretical framework. We need to think about modeling context, understanding the research and presenter relationship, conversation model in social domain, contextual roles, and furthermore incorporating holistic view. Multiple models can set up a common ground for understanding context, relationships of design between end user, designer, and engineer. Once we have rich data that are grounded in theoretical frameworks, we need to take information from it and make it believable so it applies to industry.

But how are we going to make something into knowledge and apply it to industry? How are we going to model things and make them recognized? Is there measurement techniques that can measure subtle emotions or different emotions experienced simultaneously? Are there measurement techniques that can be reasonably applied across cultures? As computing moves to an increasingly collaborative and ubiquitous model, what are the challenges of affect measurement when moving beyond individual to group levels?
