<p>Bonne Année!</p>

It is indeed a pleasure for me to bring out the first edition of the year. Looking back at 2008, it had been a year of highs and lows. And I am not just talking about dramatic rise and fall of oil prices but inflation rate, commodity prices, major indices, etc. Also agree that 2008 had been year of many first times, First time price of a barrel of oil soared this high, first time markets tumble by this many points in a day, and first time America got an African-American president. Not only did we spot a black hole the first time in our galaxy but we went on to catch a glimpse of it in our economic growth and earnings too.

Then again, year 2008 was the year that set the motion of change. This year made people all over the world sit back and ask - Is capitalism right? Ironically, we saw governments take control and decide which firm survives or which perish – for a change neither the investors nor the markets did this.

But history tells us that liberal capitalist system will survive these crises and downturns. Capitalism may rub countries in the wrong way where it has shallow roots or where pseudo-capitalism is practiced. Undoubtedly and obviously, the answers to many of the economic crises lie in free-market capitalism, globalization and transparency in market and businesses. Already we have been hearing terms such as creative capitalism, sustainable capitalism, ethical capitalism thrown in by our economists and policy makers.

Most of the issues will spill over to 2009 but our learnings from previous year will help us to adopt to change. Change in the way we run our businesses and the way spend our hard earned money.

We have seen and will see more business players moving from saturated enterprise market to gain more market share in Midmarket and SMB segments. Also moving their businesses to emerging and developing economies to endure and sustain their businesses during such downturns.

I know this is too much of a humdrum talk, so let us tear down our anxieties by welcoming the New Year with exuberance.
